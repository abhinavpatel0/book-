The "Reject Known Bad" approach in input validation involves maintaining a blacklist of known malicious strings or patterns and blocking any data that matches these entries. While it might seem effective, this method is generally regarded as the least effective approach for several reasons:
https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html

1. **Variety of Input**: Web application vulnerabilities can be exploited using a wide range of inputs, which may be encoded or represented in various ways. A blacklist is likely to miss some patterns of input that can be used to attack the application, especially with new or evolving attack techniques

2. **Evolving Exploitation Techniques**: Attack techniques constantly evolve, meaning novel methods for exploiting existing vulnerabilities might bypass current blacklists. Blacklist-based filters can often be bypassed easily by making trivial adjustments to the input.

3. **False Positives**: Blacklists can prevent legitimate input from being accepted. For example, names like "O'Brian" can be erroneously blocked due to the presence of the apostrophe, which might be considered a potentially harmful character in some contexts

4. **Inefficiency Compared to Whitelisting**: Whitelisting, or "Accept Known Good" approach, is generally preferred as it defines exactly what is allowed, making it easier to manage and more robust against unknown attacks. This method focuses on validating data for type, length, format, and range, and is usually more effective at ensuring data integrity【6†source】.

5. **Need for Defense in Depth**: While blacklist validation can be part of a multi-layered defense strategy, relying solely on it is inadequate. A comprehensive input validation strategy should include whitelisting, type checking, length checking, and sanitization to ensure robustness.

In practice, while it is useful for quickly addressing some security issues in deployed applications, the "Reject Known Bad" approach should not be the primary or sole method of input validation. Instead, it should complement more effective methods like whitelisting and proper sanitization to enhance overall security.

Ensuring safe data handling in web applications is crucial to prevent various types of attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and others. Here are some key strategies and concepts for robust data handling, as outlined in the provided text:

### Safe Data Handling

1. **Inherent Safety in Data Processing**:
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
   - Design application functionality to avoid unsafe practices, like passing user input directly to an OS command interpreter.

### Semantic Checks

- **Contextual Validation**:
  - Input from an attacker may look identical to legitimate input. The difference lies in the context. For instance, validating an account number to ensure it belongs to the logged-in user helps prevent unauthorized access.

### Boundary Validation

1. **Trust Boundaries**:
   - The core security issue arises because data from users is untrusted. Validations must occur when data crosses these trust boundaries, particularly from the client to the server.

2. **Distributed Validation**:
   - Instead of a single validation at the external boundary, perform validation at multiple stages within the application.
   - Each component of the application should treat its inputs as potentially malicious and validate them accordingly.

### Practical Example: User Login Process

1. **Initial Input Validation**:
   - Validate login details for permitted characters, length, and absence of attack signatures.

2. **SQL Query Construction**:
   - Escape any characters in user input that might be used to attack the database.

3. **SOAP Service Interaction**:
   - Encode XML metacharacters in user profile data before passing it to a SOAP service.

4. **Output Sanitization**:
   - HTML-encode any user-supplied data before displaying it in the browser to prevent XSS attacks.

### Advantages of Boundary Validation

- **Component-Specific Defenses**:
  - Each component defends against specific crafted input relevant to its function.
  
- **Stage-Specific Checks**:
  - Validation is performed based on the data's state after each transformation, addressing various potential attacks.

### Illustration of Boundary Validation

Consider a login process:
- **Step 1**: Initial validation of user input for characters, length, and attack signatures.
- **Step 2**: SQL query is constructed with escaped characters to prevent injection.
- **Step 3**: Profile data passed to a SOAP service is encoded to prevent SOAP injection.
- **Step 4**: Data displayed to the user is HTML-encoded to prevent XSS.

If additional components are involved, similar validation steps should be applied at each new trust boundary.

By adopting these principles and strategies, web applications can better protect against a wide range of input-based attacks and ensure data integrity and security across all stages of processing.
